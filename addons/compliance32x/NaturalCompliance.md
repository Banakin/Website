  NaturalCompliance is a resource pack for Minecraft Java Edition that works as an add-on for Compliance.
  This add-on is a collection of other add-ons and custom self-made textures to ensure compatability and the best possible user experience.
  It is an attempt to make Minecraft look more realistic and overall a little bit better.
