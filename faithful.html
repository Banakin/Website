<h2 class="display-4 my-5 text-center">Faithful was never officially licensed to xMrVizzy, also known as Kraineff, for use or for commercial gain.</h2>
<h3 class="display my-5 text-center">
	As such, Vattic has asked him to cease and desist use of the Faithful name, remove it from the Minecraft Bedrock Marketplace, and cease development of his version of the pack. Vattic has turned over use to the makers of Classic Faithful (Formerly EM) and Compliance to continue Faithful officially as a community-run project. The website is currently in a transitional period and the official link to Faithful will be <a href="https://faithfulpack.net">faithfulpack.net</a> when the site is complete.
