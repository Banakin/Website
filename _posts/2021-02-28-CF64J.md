long_text: "**The 64x part in the Classic Faithful lineup, aiming to bring back the original painted look of Vattic's Faithful pack.** <br><br>Initially named “Emulated Vattic Textures”, or “EM” for short, this pack was an official continuation of HiTeeN's Faithful 64x, which got discontinued many years ago due to a number of factors. While another Faithful 64x was created more recently, it was made with a much more detailed and modern style, compared to Vattic and HiTeeN's work which was much more "painted" in nature.<br><br>Now, this "painted" look is back, in 64x and with the new Minecraft textures.<br><br>[NOTE: Only the latest version for Minecraft Java is supported currently, and the pack is not entirely completed so there will be missing textures]"
