long_text: "Welcome to the new year! Our team has been hard at work creating some long-awaited textures and improving existing ones, making this one of our largest changelogs in quite some time! Villagers, their angry neighbors, and their undead brethren are all looking incredibly fashionable, cats have finally received some much-needed grooming, and much of nature's beautiful blocks have been updated! Our armorers have finally gotten back to work and provided some shiny, new armor. Many wood-related blocks have also been improved to look more... chippy. This Beta also brings several UI improvements for Bedrock players.<br><br>Thank you for your patience, and we hope you enjoy!<br><br>[NOTE: This version of the pack is compatible with both Java 1.17.1 and 1.18.1. For convenience, we are releasing the update as a single pack. That means you'll get a warning when trying to use the pack in 1.17.1, but you can safely disregard it.]"
