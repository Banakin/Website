<h2>Why did we create the Compliance organization?</h2>
<p align="justify">
  Compliance was launched on November 5, 2020, to create a set of community-based resource packs based on mutual help,
  following the controversy created by the person who unofficially took over Faithful. Compliance is a do-over of
  Faithful, but presents the same objectives with different ideologies.
</p>
<br>
<h2>What does Compliance mean?</h2>
<p align="justify">
  Although this name sounds a bit strange, it is synonymous with the word "Faithful" which we cannot use. Compliance means
  close to the same thing while also sounding reasonably good, so we chose that. The name is meant to show that the
  resource packs conform to the default textures of Minecraft.
</p>
<br>
<h2>What are our goals?</h2>
<p align="justify">
  The goal of Compliance is to create textures respecting the basic ideology of default Minecraft textures, without adding
  too much colour or distorting their original shapes. We try to only add extra details when they are absolutely necessary
  for making textures.
</p>
<br>
<h2>What are the Compliance projects?</h2>
<p align="justify">
  Currently, Compliance is split into six different projects:
  <ul>
    <li>Compliance 32x: a 32x version of the Minecraft resource pack.</li>
    <li>Compliance 64x: a 64x version of the Minecraft resource pack.</li>
    <li>Compliance Mods: 32x texture support for many mods and modpacks.</li>
    <li>Compliance Dungeons: a mod providing 32x textures for Minecraft Dungeons.</li>
    <li>Compliance Add-Ons: many additional smaller resource pack on top of 32x or 64x to change your game experience.</li>
    <li>Compliance Tweaks: essentially like add-ons, but only with small tweaks.</li>
  </ul>
</p>
<br>
<h2>Who can participate to the project?</h2>
<p align="justify">
  Anyone can contribute to one or more of our resource packs. There are several Discord servers dedicated to each project
  and the process of pushing textures to 32x and 64x is automated, but submissions must respect <a href="https://docs.compliancepack.net/pages/textures/texturing-guidelines.html">our guidelines</a> to keep a consistent pack.
  <br>
  Regarding third-party projects such as Compliance Dungeons or Compliance Mods, more information is available on their
  respective Discord servers.
